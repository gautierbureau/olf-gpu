/**
 * The per-scenario target/row-mode changes a generator loss applies on the device: remove the lost
 * generator's P from its bus's P target ({@code pRow}→{@code pTarget}); if the loss un-controls the bus
 * ({@code toPq}) flip its BUS_V row to the reactive-power equation and set {@code vRow}→{@code qTarget}.
 * Mirrors {@code LfContingency.processLostGenerators}.
 *
 * <p>When the lost generator sits on a distributed-slack participant bus, {@code dsBus} is that bus's
 * DS-pack index (else -1) and the {@code ds*Delta} fields carry the reweight the device applies: the
 * bus's participation factor, base target P, headroom and footroom each shrink by the lost gen's share,
 * and the per-scenario factor sum drops by {@code dsFactorDelta} so the other buses absorb that share.
 * This is only valid when the slack itself does not participate (otherwise the loss is rejected).
